Recursion in a graphql schema is possible. This presents some denial-of-service vulnerabilities in our graphql server. Why? 

If two types have reference to each other, you have now exposed a cyclical query:

type A {
    b: B
}

type B {
   a: A
}

An attacker could exploit this and submit an extremely large query containing A - B - A - B - A - B etc. Depending how your server resolves these elements, will have different side effects. Your graphql server could make thousands of extra network requests, perform expensive CPU operations, bring down your server with out-of-memory error or saturate all tomcat request threads, denying other users access to the graphql server. 

There are various ways to mitigate this vulnerability, one simple way is by using a GraphQL query max depth limit. Requests will be rejected that request a query depth exceeding the limit. This can be specified in graphql spring boot with the property:

graphql.servlet.maxQueryDepth
```

```

Selection Set
```

```
A selection set is the set of fields the user requested. 

Having direct access to the fields can enable you to make performance optimized queries requesting only the needed data. For example an SQL backed system may be able to use the field sub selection to only retrieve the columns that have been asked for.

If you look ahead in the selection set, you may be able to optimize further and collapse two backend resource calls into one. For example, if you can retrieve the sellingLocations data within the products API call. You can group everything into one API query instead of two.

query {
        products {
            # the fields below represent the selection set
            name
            description
            sellingLocations {
                state
            }
        }
    }

The selection set (DataFetchingFieldSelectionSet) contains many useful utility methods such as:  contains, containsAnyOf, containsAnyOf. These can be used as the predicate to make your API call selection. 

To get the requested field names you can stream the fields, filter and collect into a set.

Scalars
```

```
A GraphQL scalar is a query leaf node that cannot be queried further via sub field selections. 
The graphql specification states that five standard scalars must always be present on the type system, these are: String, Int, Float, Boolean and ID.

It is very common that the standard five scalars are not descriptive enough. For example, how do we return a Date or DateTime? As a string? This is where we can create our own custom scalar implementations to define a more specific data type. 

Here, I introduce the java graphql extended scalars dependency (graphql-java-extended-scalars) which contains many out-of-the-box scalars for Date, DateTime, PositiveInt, NonNegativeInt and many many more. You can additionally create your own by creating an implementation of GraphQLScalarType and following the patterns from the extended scalars.


I just love the Numeric scalars:

PositiveInt
        An Int scalar that MUST be greater than zero.
NegativeInt
        An Int scalar that MUST be less than zero.
NonPositiveInt
        An Int scalar that MUST be less than or equal to zero.
NonNegativeInt
        An Int scalar that MUST be greater than or equal to zero.
PositiveFloat
        An Float scalar that MUST be greater than zero.
NegativeFloat
        An Float scalar that MUST be less than zero.
NonPositiveFloat
        An Float scalar that MUST be less than or equal to zero.
NonNegativeFloat
        An Float scalar that MUST be greater than or equal to zero.

Input Validation

There are two ways of validating your graphql input types, via Directives or manually validating the input type in your resolver. In this episode we focus on the more old-school approach and put the JSR-303 bean validation annotations on our pojos. In a following tutorial, we will look at graphql-java-extended-validation which will allow us to remove all java bean validation annotations, and instead place the annotations directly on the schema. Pretty cool. 

As graphql-java-extended-validation is still under active development and first stable release was 2 days ago (17 September 2020) I will provide tutorials on both validation methods .

Listener

The GraphQL Servlet library allows you to add a Servlet Listener for listening to the GraphQL request. It provides hooks into the servlet request execution (request, success, error, and finally).

The Servlet Listener listens to the servlet request, but not to the GraphQL query execution. If you want to listen to that (pre/post resolver methods etc) you should use the Instrumentation provided by GraphQL Java.

Pagination (Edges, Nodes, Cursor)

GraphQL Spring Boot supports the recommended relay connection cursor pagination pattern.

In this video, I implement the relay @connection directive and create a matching resolver with the graphql java relay Connection, Edges, Nodes, 
PageInfo, StartCursor, EndCursor, isHasPreviousPage, isHasNextPage and Cursor package / classes.

I have found that cursor-based pagination is the most powerful pagination pattern so-far. 

Especially if the graphql cursors are opaque, and the real cursor value is used in combination with the SEEK sql pattern (or equivalent in other data stores). 
Making the graphql cursor opaque (base 64 encoded) provides the additional flexibility if the pagination model changes in the future. 
For example, the graphql api customers  / UI only needs to change the input filters and can consistently use the cursor to offset the next pages. 
The UI does not need to know about the cursors real value, which parameter to set it in and in which format. It just supplies the edge's cursor to the 'after'. So... what I'm getting at is... the UI can stay simple :)

Custom Context


In graphql spring boot, you have the ability to create a custom object once at the very start of the query/mutation, and this object will be available
to all mutations and queries via the DataFetchingEnvironment. The custom object can be any type, and is never used by the internal graphql java framework.


As the context is created once and available in all revolvers; a common use-case to store user authorization data such as user id, permissions 
and roles. This data can then be used to perform authorization on your mutation and resolvers. An alternative to this is spring security and
pass the security context to other threads via DelegatingSecurityContextExecutorService. But the context file can contain anything you wish.

Data Loader

The dreaded graphql N+1 problem gives most devs the creeps. 

By default in GraphQL, a query resolver will resolve a field's nodes sequentially. When you have a list (see connection cursor video linked below) of nodes, It will resolve each node's fields sequentially. For example if you have 2 nodes with field X  in the selection set. It will execute the query resolver first, then resolver for Node1 Field X followed by Node2 Field X. This is the N+1 problem. 


I simulate how a small backend API latency can introduce massive latency into your graphql API. That is with dataloader neglect.


In most cases you would want to group together Field X values and batch them to the backing API. This leads to massive performance gains in reduction of network traffic and optimal database queries on the datasource. 

Here we use the Java graphql dataloader (a direct port of facebook's dataloader) to solve this problem. We can easily use CompletableFutures to load the IDs and I recommend using  a mapped batch dataloader. With the DataLoader creation you can customize the cache and maximum batch size with the DataLoaderOptions parameter.


Often there is not a 1:1 mapping of your batch loaded keys to the values returned.
For example, a SQL query may return fewer results than query IDs. (does not exist or duplicates).
If you would use the classic dataloader, then the values would be returned into the wrong requesting nodes and the last (Requested Ids minus responded ids) would have null values. This is because it mays 1:1 by default. Big trouble here.


To get around this, we can return a map from the dataloader function. When the map is processed by the DataLoader code, any keys that are missing in the map will be replaced with null values. The semantic that the number of DataLoader.load requests are matched with an equal number of values is kept.

The keys provided MUST be first class keys since they will be used to examine the returned map and create the list of results, with nulls filling in for missing values.

Single Network Call For Every Single Node, Latency Of First Request Will Be Added To The Second Request And So On.

Correlation ID (Thread propagation)

used to identify which req depicts user action when there are multiple users

In a multi-threaded graphql server it is imperative to propagate a request correlation id to all threads invoked. This will ensure all threads can log the correlation id which will then provide insight into the code flow and ultimately which request triggered that section of code. If you log the original graphql query and variables with the correlation ID, you can now link any log to the original graphql request. Very useful for debugging then exceptions :)

We first create an Instrumentation class and override the beginExecution method. Inside this method we assign a unique correlation id to the loggers mapped diagnostic context (MDC). As our graphql service is an edge node, no upstream service will provide a correlation id to graphql. We therefor can use the graphql Execution ID. This a UUID generated by the graphql framework for each request. We then return a whenCompleted callback to clear the MDC. It’s important to do this as we want to ensure the MDC does not contain any values from the previous request.  You can set an additional MDC.clear on a listener’s onComplete() method to ensure the original NIO thread has been cleared. As an alternative, the listener onRequest() method can also be used to set the original MDC on the tomcat NIO thread.

We then customize the logback console appender to print the %X{correlation_id} with every log line. 

This will allow us to paste a correlation id into our log viewer tool and get every log line. E.g. Splunk, Sumo-logic & Logentries.

But wait! At this stage, the MDC is only tied to the NIO tomcat thread. 
How do we propagate it to all threads such as dataloaders and async completable futures?

To solve this, we create a Correlation ID propagation executor service. This class will get the MDC correlation ID from the current thread and set it into the MDC map in the new executing thread in the target thread pool. Right before the thread is ready to accept another unit of work, we clear the MDC map. This can then be chained throughout all threads and will propagate and clear the MDC as required.

Integration Testing (GraphQLTestTemplate)

While developing a graphql server it is equally important to develop your integration tests. This can be achieved in java spring boot with the class GraphQLTestTemplate and the graphql-spring-boot-starter-test dependency.


But first, why do we need integration tests?
Having a set of integration tests for your graphql server will allow you to make changes with confidence. 
These help ensure that you didn't introduce any bugs or regressions.
You can be more comfortable when performing upgrades in dependencies, especially major bumps. 
Ensure that you didn't change the graphql serialized json, this could easily break clients.
Ensure your business functionality actually works as expected.
Ensure downstream services are called (wiremock, grpcmock)
New developer team mates can join the product and see sample requests and responses.  They can be more comfortable making changes at an early stage.
Overall, you will go faster.

Approach:


We first create a src/it/java and src/it/resources packages and update our maven build to include those tests. Here we include the following plugins to our POM: maven-resources-plugin, build-helper-maven-plugin, maven-failsafe-plugin and testResources.


We then create a IT test class per resolver. 
This test will start an in-memory graphql spring boot server. 
We then create graphql queries together with the expected responses and copy/paste them into files in the resources package. 
We then use junit5 to create unit tests that will each load a graphql query, submit it to the server using GraphQLTestTemplate. We then can load the matching expected graphql response file from the classpath and assert it equals the response. This can be achieved with library skyscreamer json assertEquals.


For dynamic elements such as a clock (LocalDateTime, Localdate etc), we create the ApplicationContext with a FixedClock. This better than mocking the clock as having the fixedclock as bean will keep our spring application context clean, thus avoid having to restart between tests. 


It is extremely important that we do not have any mocks or spy beans in the integration tests. As they will cause the context to dirty, therefore requiring a restart of the server between junit tests and slowing down the build considerably.

JVM Profiling

rofiling your java application has massive benefits, such as increasing the chance of finding redundant memory allocation and memory leaks. The first being critical for low latent and highly concurrent APIs.

In this tutorial we will plant a memory allocation bug and identify it with VisualVM.

The first thing we do it setup a small Apache JMeter load testing script for our GraphQL requests. We configure this to send 3 concurrent batches of 1000 requests.

We then start our spring boot graphql server with the VisualVM IntelliJ launcher. Navigate to your application and select the profile tab. Open settings and add an asterisk symbol to record all classes/methods. Click start profiling.

Execute the Jmeter script. 
Navigate back to VisualVM and stop the profiler.

You should now have insight into hot stack traces, heavy method calls and heap memory allocation. If you see "Unknown", restart VisualVM... sometimes it has this bug.

VisualVM identified the memory allocation bug and told us the exact class and method. Thanks!!! 

You can also try the sampling tab for memory allocation and CPU profiling.

Other than the above, there are many kinds of application metrics you should consider such as 

Service percentiles 
Service availablity / uptime
Internal http/grpc client percentiles
Executor metrics (queue depth etc)
GC execution
Kubernetes memory requests
JVM memory
Method counts
Exception counts / classes
GraphQL queries / execution time
GraphQL resolver execution time / counts
Kubernetes CPU requests
Database connection pools
etc etc etc!


Other tools I like are, micrometer, stackdriver, java mission control and gatling load testing.

DataLoader Key Context

To solve this problem, we can load the ID with a context into the dataloader. In this example, the context is BankAccount. The IDs mapped to Contexts are accessible inside the dataloader function via the BatchLoaderEnvironment#getKeyContexts. Unfortunately this returns a Map(Object, Object) instead of the preferred generic types, so we loose type safety. To get around this, we cast this to Map, then we pass the Map into our function with Map(UUID, BankAccount) defined as the method parameters. 


But, why don't we just load the BankAccount into the dataloader?
This sounds good and easy - BUT If you do that, then we no-longer get the speed from the UUID hashmap lookups. So we always use the most efficient key possible.

Spring Security

In order to use pre-auth, you must ensure that all graphql requests have been previously authorized by an upstream service. For example, All Ingres traffic to this graphql service must bypass an upstream proxy node that will validate the request’s JWT token. If the JWT token is valid, then the proxy will forward the request into this graphql server. This code alone provides no authorization and is not production ready alone. Read more about pre-auth patterns before using this. 

This proxy pattern is getting more common among kubernetes / service-mesh / side car enabled technologies such as istio. You will find an istio security architecture diagram linked at the bottom of this bio. There are many sidecar proxy options such as Kong or Envoy. 

Personally I see many benefits of this pattern, as we can extract boilerplate, hard to maintain, error prone authorization configuration OUT of our application code. 

This allows for a clearer separation of concerns. Authorization policies and mutual TLS in one world, and application code in another. 

Forwarding additional headers containing the extracted authorization data may allow for a smoother transition to support other authentication methods. For example, if you can avoid your app code from decoding JWT base64 or having specific auth logic - then you can focus on the sidecar auth migration with minimal application code changes. Just think if you have 30+ microservices? An alternative would be to support a shared library and bump the app’s dependencies first. 


The spring security context is thread bound. Luckily we can propagate the spring security context into our thread pools and executors. This will allow us to have spring security annotations and method level security on asynchronous threads / execution. For example @Async. You can propagate the security context by wrapping your executor in Spring's DelegatingSecurityContextExecutorService. Java doc linked below.


In the video I forgot to mark the PreAuthenticatedAuthenticationProvider as a Spring Bean. That's why you see the default spring security fallback user/password on the logs.
